# Sample Vulnerable Solidity Repo

This is a deliberately vulnerable smart contract repository for demo purposes.

Contains 10+ files with common pitfalls: reentrancy, missing access control, integer overflow (<=0.8), unchecked call, tx.origin auth, predictable randomness, unbounded loops, and poor error handling.
